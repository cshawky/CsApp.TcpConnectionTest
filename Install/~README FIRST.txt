CShawky Tools (CsTool)

This is an alpha release time limited.

Run Install.cmd in elevated mode to install the executable to Program Files.

For non administrative install, copy the entire folder CsApp.TcpConnectionTest somewhere, even your desktop.

If run from Program files (by double clicking), your config and logs will end up in C:\ProgramData

If you create a shortcut to the executable and set the Startup folder to say C:\Temp\Instance1 then your config and logs will
be stored in C:\Temp\Instance1. That means you can create multiple shortcuts to target different startup folders and hence run
multiple configurations.

Tooltips are available, look at the logs and xml configuration files. The app config is in your startup folder or ProgramData.

The system defaults are stored with the executable, normally under Program Files.

Enjoy.
